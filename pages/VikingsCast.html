    <div class="charabt">
  <h3>Ragnar Lothbrok:</h3>
  <p>Ragnar Sigurdsson, popularly known as Ragnar Lothbrok, (Shaggy Breeches) was the main protagonist of Vikings until his death in Part 2 of Season 4. He was the father of Bjorn and Gyda, the brother of Rollo and the ex-husband of Lagertha.
  <br/>
  According to the Seer, Ragnar was born and raised in the lands near Kattegat, in southern Norway, and earned a reputation as a clever boy. When Ragnar was 15, King Froh of Svealand invaded Norway and killed the Norwegian King Siward. Ragnar joined with Siward-loyalists to drive out Froh. King Froh was famous for carrying tame serpents around his neck in battle whom would bite his enemies while he fought them. For the purpose of fighting Froh, Ragnar fashioned a coat and breeches from a hairy animalhide. In the battle that followed, Ragnar faced off with Froh and the serpents could not bite through the hide for all the hair. Because of his unusual way of defeating the king at such an early age, Ragnar earned his name "Lothbrok", the hairybreeches. At one point, Ragnar went to Lagertha's home to confess his love to her, but he was set upon by a bear and an enormous hound who guarded her home. Ragnar killed the bear with his spear and strangled the hound with his bare hands, thus gaining Lagertha's hand in marriage.
<br/>
The Seer had once prophesied that Ragnar will have many sons. Bjorn is the first of these.
  </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="Lagertha" class="tabcontent">
<div class="charimg"><img src="../images/lagertha.jpg"/></div>
<div class="charabt">
  <h3>Lagertha:</h3>
  <p>
  Lagertha is a skilled shield maiden, the first and ex wife of Ragnar Lothbrok and the second Queen of Kattegat.
<br/>
Since the loss of her daughter Gyda and her unborn child with Ragnar, Lagertha realized that Freyja's fertility is meant for another, and that it is the goddess' warrior aspect that speaks to her fellow Valkyrie. Lagertha remained fiercely independent when it came to protecting her family—and the throne, before being overthrown by Ivar, the youngest son of Ragnar with the first Queen, Aslaug who swears revenge on Lagertha for murdering his mother.
<br/>
Lagertha was brought up by her father to be a Shield-maiden.
<br/>
At an unspecified time, Ragnar went to Lagertha's home to confess his love for her, but he was set upon by a bear and an enormous hound who guarded her home. Ragnar killed the bear with his spear and strangled the hound with his bare hands, thus gaining her hand in marriage. It is unknown if Ragnar's story is real or a child friendly tale to his son Björn referencing his battle with Rollo (known as a "bear") over Lagertha's love, as Lagertha also had a relationship with Rollo and is unsure who is Björn's biological father.
  </p> 
</div>
</div>

<div id="Bjorn" class="tabcontent">
  <div class="charimg"><img src="../images/bjorn.png"/></div>
  <div class="charabt">
  <h3>Bjorn Ironside:</h3>
  <p>
  Björn Ironside is the eldest son of Ragnar Lothbrok and Lagertha. Although later it is revealed his uncle Rollo might be his biological father, Björn believes he is Ragnar's son. He is the third husband of Torvi and heir of Kattegat. Loyal and emulating his wise father, Björn had made a name for himself, following in his father's footsteps as a formidable warrior, leader, and explorer. He shares his father's thirst for adventure and wishes to explore faraway lands.
  <br/>
  Upon turning 12 and coming of age in Viking society, Björn received his arm ring from the then reigning Earl Haraldson. Björn had yearned to be a warrior like his father, desperate for recognition as a man and to fight in the raids with his father, but his youth and inexperience hold him back. Björn is a loyal and dutiful son to both parents, and showed no fear when he broke up a physical fight between his parents in Wrath of the Northmen.
<br/>
Though obedient to his parents, Björn resented being put under the supervision of the young Northumbrian monk Athelstan who was captured as a slave from Lindisfarne.
<br/>
Brought along by Ragnar on his trip to Gotaland for King Horik, Björn was witness to the beginning of his father's relationship with Aslaug. Disgusted, Björn confronted his father about his infidelity, making him swear that it will never happen again. While Ragnar did promise this and tried to keep it, Aslaug had already become pregnant with a son.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ubbe" class="tabcontent">
<div class="charimg"><img src="../images/ubbe.jpg"/></div>
  <div class="charabt">
  <h3>Ubbe:</h3>
  <p>
  Ubbe is the first son of Ragnar Lothbrok and Aslaug. He was conceived out of wedlock which would have made him a bastard, but with Ragnar's marriage to Aslaug and divorce of Largetha he became Ragnar's legitmate son and heir. He is the second oldest of Ragnar's son and arguably the most mellow. He also closely resembles his father when he was a young man. He was married to Margrethe, but he is now married to Torvi, who was previously his older brother, Bjorn's wife.
  <br/>
  Ubbe was born in the four year gap between Season 2 Episodes 1 and 2. 
<br/>
A young Ubbe is mostly seen with his mother Aslaug and his younger brother, Hvitserk. Ubbe flees with Aslaug, Hvitserk, Rollo, Siggy, and Helga after Jarl Borg invades Kattegat.
<br/>
Ragnar eventually returns from England, whereupon he is reunited with his family. With the assistance of Lagertha and Bjorn, his first family, he takes back Kattegat from Jarl Borg. To exact revenge, Ragnar performs the blood eagle on Jarl Borg
  </p>

<div id="Ivar" class="tabcontent">
  <div class="charimg"><img src="../images/ivar.jpg"/></div>
  <div class="charabt">
  <h3>Ivar the Boneless:</h3>
  <p>
  Ivar Ragnarsson, named Ivar the Boneless by his father due to his disease, is the youngest son of Ragnar Lothbrok and Aslaug and the second King of Kattegat after his father. He swears revenge on Lagertha for killing his mother and against Kings Aelle and Ecbert for Ragnar's death.
  <br/>
  Conceived after his father's return from England, Aslaug had been giving Ragnar several counsels, forewarning things to come. Aslaug had warned that they should not have sex for at least three days, knowing of a prophecy that threatened the prospective child's health, but Ragnar insisted. Because Ragnar did not heed her warnings, Ivar was born with weak bones, his legs twisted and seemingly broken, hence the nickname "Boneless".
<br/>
When he was born, Aslaug and Ragnar feared for his difficult life. Ragnar, as well as Siggy, suggested that Ivar should be killed, though Aslaug refused. Ragnar once took him out in an attempt to kill him himself; however, Ragnar could not bring himself to do so. When Aslaug told Ragnar his name, Ragnar gave him the epithet "Boneless".
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ecbert" class="tabcontent">
<div class="charimg"><img src="../images/ecbert.jpg"/></div>
  <div class="charabt">
  <h3>King Ecbert:</h3>
  <p>
  King Ecbert was the worldly and ambitious King of Wessex and Mercia, whose formative years were spent in the court of the Emperor Charlemagne. An ambitious and open-minded man of strength, knowledge and the willingness to use those qualities decisively. He had developed a strong respect for his new foe/ally Ragnar Lothbrok.
  <br/>
  Having saved Athelstan from a cross - the monk having been crucified for apostasy - Ecbert regards Athelstan as a kindred spirit, and one versed in Latin. The king puts the monk in charge of his treasury of ancient Roman relics and documents left over from Rome's domination of Britain centuries prior. Athelstan is tasked with interpreting and preserving the many scrolls of Roman parchment. From the scrolls, Athelstan conveys to Ecbert detailed accounts of the battlefield strategies of the Roman legions.
<br/>
Having delved into the military mind of Caesar, King Ecbert puts his new knowledge to use when confronting the latest incursion - the largest to date - by Ragnar Lothbrok into Wessex, this raid including the forces of King Horik and Lagertha. Allied with King Aelle of Northumbria, Ecbert ambushes the advancing Viking horde with a multiple-pronged attack that includes both mounted cavalry and infantry. Confounded by Ecbert's tactics, taking heavy losses, and assailed from all sides, the Vikings are forced to fight their way out of the trap and into headlong retreat. King Ecbert's victory is decisive. In the aftermath of the battle, King Aelle expresses surprise at Ecbert's skill as a tactician.
<br/>
When Aelle suggests finishing off the Northmen, however, Ecbert demonstrates his keener political vision, responding that more might be gained by negotiating a truce. Additionally, upon realizing that Ragnar's brother, Rollo, had been wounded and captured during the battle, Ecbert had his life spared and his wounds tended to. Rollo, he realized, was an important and potentially useful captive. Rollo's release is part of the deal later struck between Ecbert and Ragnar that granted the Northmen 5,000 acres of good farming land, as well as a quantity of gold and silver. King Ecbert, in turn, is able to recruit a contingent of Viking warriors willing to fight as mercenaries for Princess Kwenthrith in her campaign to rule the kingdom of Mercia.

<div id="Harald" class="tabcontent">
<div class="charimg"><img src="../images/harald.jpg"/></div>
  <div class="charabt">
  <h3>King Harald:</h3>
  <p>
  Harald "Finehair" is a Scandinavian warlord and king. He was a threat for Ragnar before his death. His dream is to become king of all Norway. He was married to Astrid before she forced Lagertha to kill her in battle.
  <br/>
  In Yol, King Harald arrives in Kattegat to meet Ragnar after hearing of his exploits in the conquest of Paris. He wants to participate in the next raid on Frankia and announces that soon his brother Halfdan "The Black" will arrive with his fleet. He becomes familiar with Ragnar's young sons.
<br/>
In What Might Have Been, Harald and his brother lead an ambush on the Frankish scouts and capture several of them. Later, they take several of the captives and tie them to the Frankish signal fires. As the men are burned alive, Harald and the other warriors cheer and praise Odin while urinating on the unfortunate Franks.
<br/>
When the Vikings travel upriver towards Paris, the ships are shot at from the forts by Frankish soldiers, led by Rollo. When the Franks raise a huge chain between the two forts to block the ships progress, Harald's ship is capsized and sunken. Harald and his brother swim to Ragnar's ship, where they defend against the Frankish assault.
<br/>
In Death All 'Round, Harald and Halfdan lead a raid on a small Frankish farm. They discover a family inside, and brutally kill them all, after raping the two daughters. They burn the farm afterward.
<br/>
Harald and the other Vikings battle the Franks head-on in The Last Ship, in brutal combat on the river. Harald fights alongside his brother and is dismayed when Halfdan is shot by a Frankish crossbowman. Harald is last seen retreating with the Viking fleet after a crushing defeat by the Franks.
<br/>
In the years following the defeat at the Second Siege of Paris, King Harald is busy expanding his realm, conquering the kingdom of Rogaland, killing King Arnarson and his earl, Eyolf. He also defeated King Svein from an unspecified Norwegian kingdom. Harald, along with his brother, Halfdan, joins Bjorn in his expedition to the Mediterranean Sea and assures Bjorn he has no intention of threatening Kattegat. When Bjorn seeks a truce with his uncle Rollo, Harald is captured along with the other Norse leaders. He questions Bjorn's judgement in trusting Rollo. Eventually, they are released when Bjorn agrees to allow Rollo to join the expedition.
<br/>
As the expedition runs short on fresh water and food, Harald privately questions Bjorn's leadership and suggests he might be cursed, like he considers Ragnar. He relents to Halfdan and brings up that their overthrow of the Lothbroks is inevitable in his quest to become king of Norway. Eventually, the fleet comes upon Algeciras and sacks the city. Floki prevents Harald and Halfdan from murdering praying Muslims: Harald directly stops his brother from entering a conflict with Floki.
<br/>
As the fleet returns to Scandinavia, Halfdan presents Harald to Egil the bastard. Harald recruits Egil as his agent and indirectly promises to make him earl. Egil begins to infiltrate Kattegat and locate weaknesses in its defenses. As the Lothbroks gather the Great Heathen Army, they ally with them once more. As forces from all over Scandinavia gather in Kattegat, Harald spots Ellisif. He reacts nervously upon seeing her and his brother encourages him to talk to her. When Harald meets Ellisif in the great hall, he tells her that he will soon be worthy of her, and he can finally cut his hair, and marry her.
<br/>
However, Ellisif confesses that she is already married to a Danish earl, a man of lower social status and fame than Harald. Harald angrily reminds her that he was already a king when she refused him and is hurt by her rejecting him for a man he considers "a nobody", stating he has based his whole life around her. Meanwhile Halfdan draws a seax to kill her. Ellisif begs him not to, and Harald lets her go. Later Halfdan suggests that they must kill Ellisif because she has taken Harald's honor. Harald refuses and reveals that he only loves two people: Halfdan and Ellisif. Harald states he will kill all those who threaten her.
<br/>
As the Great Heathen Army lands in Northumbria, Harald partakes in the Battle of York. In camp, Harald kills Ellisif's husband, Earl Vik, to avenge the offense that has gnawed away at him. Later, he falls for Ellisif's pretention of renewed interest in him, and they start to make love. Before it goes too far, however, Ellisif pulls a blade and tries to kill him to avenge her husband's death. Halfdan, however, had been suspicious and watching, and kills her. Harald is left distraught by Ellisif's attempt to kill him and to have lost the only woman that he has ever loved.
<br/>
Later, he partakes in the Battle of Repton, as Aethelwulf's forces are crushed.

<div class="charimg"><img src="../images/halfdan.jpeg"/></div>
  <div class="charabt">
  <h3>Halfdan:</h3>
  <p>
  Halfdan was the brother of Norwegian King Harald "Finehair". Bjorn saved his life but he was later killed by his own brother.
  <br/>
  He arrives in Kattegat in "Promised", along with the rest of his brother's ships and warriors: 20 ships carrying 600 warriors. When Harald introduced him to Ragnar, he seemed to not care about his presence. Later, his brother and him met Floki and Helga. Halfdan asked the boatbuilder why he has been in conflict with Ragnar despite the great role his longboat design played in Ragnar's achievements. Floki answered that it was because he killed his "pet christian" before they drank to their new friendship.
<br/>
In "What Might Have Been", Halfdan ambushes the Frankish scouts alongside his brother, and is one of several Vikings seen torturing them by burning them alive. Halfdan even goes so far as to urinate on one of the scouts as he is being burned.
<br/>
Halfdan is seen raiding a small Frankish farm in "Death All 'Round" with Harald and several other warriors. When the brothers discover the family living on the farm they rape and slaughter them, then burn it to the ground.
<br/>
In "The Last Ship", Halfdan battles the Franks alongside Harald and the rest of their warriors. He slays several of them before being shot in the chest by a crossbow. Halfdan is later seen sailing back home with the other Vikings, injured, but still alive.
<br/>
In the years following the defeat at the Second Siege of Paris, king Harald conquered the kingdom of Rogaland, killing king Arnarson and his earl Eyolf. He also defeated King Svein from an unspecified norwegian kingdom. Harald joins Bjorn in his expedition to the Mediterranean Sea and assures Bjorn he has no intention of conquering Kattegat. When Bjorn seeks a truce with his uncle Rollo, Harald is captured along with the other Norse leaders. He questions Bjorn's judgement in trusting Rollo. Eventually they are released when Bjorn agrees to allow Rollo to join the expedition.
<br/>
Eventually, the fleet comes upon Algeciras and sacks the city. Floki prevents Harald and Halfdan from murdering praying muslims: Harald directly stops his brother from entering a conflict with Floki.
<br/>
As the fleet returns to Scandinavia, Halfdan presents Harald to Egil. Harald recruits Egil as his agent and indirectly promises to make him earl. Egil begins to infiltrate Kattegat and locate weaknesess in it's defences. As the Lothbroks gather the Great Heathen Army, they ally with them once more. As recruits from all over Scandinavia arrives in Kattegat, Harald spots Ellisif. Halfdan is confused about Harald's nervous behavior upon seeing Ellisif and encourages him to talk to her.
<br/>
Ellisif confesses to Harald that she is already married to a Danish earl, a man of lower social status and fame than Harald. Halfdan pulls a dagger to kill her. Ellisif begs him not to, and Harald lets her go. Later Halfdan suggests that they must kill Ellisif because she has taken Harald's honor. Harald refuses and reveals that he only loves two people: Halfdan and Ellisif. Harald states he will kill all those who threaten her.
<br/>
As the Great Heathen Army lands in Northumbria, Halfdan partakes in the First Battle of the Great Heathen Army. He kills Ellisif when she tries to kill his brother to avenge his husband (Earl Vik). 
<br/>
Later, he partakes in the Battle of Repton, as Aethelwulf's forces are crushed. At the end of Season Four, he decides to follow Bjorn to explore the Mediterranean Sea, shocking his brother.

<div id="Rollo" class="tabcontent">
<div class="charimg"><img src="../images/rollo.jpg"/></div>
  <div class="charabt">
  <h3>Rollo:</h3>
  <p>
  Rollo Sigurdsson, also known as Rolf, is Ragnar Lothbrok's older brother and the Duke of Normandy. He is the husband of the Frankish princess Gisla, and father of William, Marcellus and Celsa. Prior to his marriage, Rollo was reputed as a fearsome Viking warrior, with an impulsive streak and wrought with internal struggles.
  <br/>
  In the episode Rites of Passage, we are first introduced to Rollo when he accompanies his younger brother Ragnar on their first raid to England which was done against Earl Haraldson orders. In this episode, Rollo makes no secret that he is attracted to Lagertha, his brother's wife and is still saddened that she chose Ragnar over him.
<br/>
In the episode Wrath of the Northmen, at the Lindisfarne Monastery in the Kingdom of Northumbria, Rollo walks in on his brother Ragnar talking to a Christian named Athelstan. Rollo insists on killing him but Ragnar forbids it as the monk is worth more alive than dead. Surprised, Rollo reminds his brother they are equals and attempts to kill Athelstan anyway. However, Ragnar pushes his brother back, causing Rollo to angrily chop the Crucifix in the room to pieces telling Athelstan that is how much he respects his God before storming off and leaving for the boats taking Athelstan, slaves and treasures with them.
<br/>
In the episode Dispossessed, unable to ignore the riches this unsanctioned journey has returned, Earl Haraldson has no choice but to agree to let these warriors undertake a second trip out. Rollo, Ragnar and the crew land on the Northumbrian shores again. This time they are welcomed by a few Angelo-Saxons Warriors, however Rollo doesn't trust them and suggests that they kill them, in which they do just that.
<br/>
In the episode Trial, Rollo, his brother and their crew sail out with Earl Haraldson’s permission and also with Earl Haraldson’s spy and brother Knut. After the bloodshed on the beach, the Vikings choose the Sabbath to invade the town of Hexam and unleash a flood of violence and panic. When Lagertha later kills Knut for trying to rape a Saxon woman and her, Ragnar falsely claims that he killed Knut so as to protect his wife and is put on trial by Earl Haraldson. Despite the Earl's attempts to bribe Rollo to turn against Ragnar, he testifies in support of his brother, who is then acquitted.
<br/>
In the episode Raid, Haraldson attempts to kill Ragnar and his family, but they escape and go into hiding. As a way of finding them, Haraldson has Rollo captured and tortured to make him reveal Ragnar's location, but Rollo refuses and remains steadfast.
<br/>
In the episode Burial of the Dead, when Ragnar learns that Haraldson has tortured his brother, he challenges the Earl to a trial by combat which the Earl accepts. When Ragnar wins the duel and kills Haraldson, the Earl's steward, Svein, yells for the other guards to kill Ragnar. At this, Rollo quickly throws an axe into Svein, killing him with satisfaction after he had been tortured by him. Despite his treatment at the hands of Earl Haraldson's men, Rollo does not bear a grudge against the Earl's widow Siggy and daughter Thyri, and even vouches for them so that they do not have to leave Kattegat. Rollo then enters into a relationship with Siggy.
<br/>
In the episode A King's Ransom, during a raid into Northumbria, the Vikings are invited into the castle of King Aelle in order to negotiate. Ragnar offers to return the King's captured brother Aethelwulf and leave Northumbria in return for a ransom payment. Aelle agrees to pay the ransom, but adds the condition that one of Ragnar's men must become Christian first, because he can only negotiate and make peace with a fellow Christian. Although Ragnar and his men laugh and balk at this stipulation, Rollo agrees to do so, to surprise of his companions.
<br/>
Rollo is baptized in the river by the Northumbrian bishop and given the Christian name Rolf. Although Rollo has little understanding of the ceremony and does not take it seriously, Floki takes considerable umbrage at Rollo's action and berates him for offending their Norse gods. Though Rollo seems to remain as staunch a pagan as any of his comrades, Floki's rebuke still unsettles him. While helping fight off an ambush from the Northumbrian's, Rollo eagerly slays as many enemy soldiers as he can. He then yells at Floki "How many Christians have I killed!"
<br/>
In the episode Sacrifice, Rollo, Siggy, and her daughter join Ragnar and his family for the pilgrimage at Uppsala. During the festivities, Rollo engages in the customary riotous behavior, such as drinking, celebrating, and having sex with other women, much to Siggy's disapproval. Rollo insists that he will be a great man someday and that Siggy would regret leaving him just because he sleeps with other women. Siggy tells him that his brother Ragnar is negotiating with King Horik. She complains to Rollo that because of his feckless behavior, he was not invited to these negotiations and is missing out on an opportunity to raise himself and improve his position.
<br/>
In the episode All Change, despite Rollo missing out on those discussions, Ragnar brings him along anyway on his mission to Jarl Borg, whom King Horik had asked Ragnar to negotiate with in order to settle a land dispute. Jarl Borg discerns that Rollo is jealous and resentful of Ragnar's success, and connives to divide the brothers against each other.
<br/>
While Ragnar is away courting Princess Aslaug, Borg allows Rollo to stay at his hall and offers him lavish hospitality, such as food, wine, and the sexual use of any of his serving wenches. He flatters Rollo and suggests that he deserves to be greater than his brother. Borg promises that if Rollo fights with him against Ragnar and King Horik, then he will be a powerful and important person. After quietly considering these offers, Rollo agrees to join Jarl Borg against King Horik and fight against his own brother.

<div id="Floki" class="tabcontent">
<div class="charimg"><img src="../images/floki.jpg"/></div>
  <div class="charabt">
  <h3>Floki:</h3>
  <p>
  Floki is a boat builder and incorrigible trickster, who also happens to be Ragnar Lothbrok's eccentric and closest friend. Committed to helping Ragnar sail west, he secretly designs and builds a new generation of Viking longboats for their voyage across the ocean westward. He is also the spouse of the late Helga, the father of the late Angrboda and adoptive father of the late Tanaruz.
<br/>
Floki typifies a neurotic person with a highly balanced personality. Possessing reasonable fear, and a vast intellect, he is able to easily build ships with special traits to them, and wisely does not hold himself as immune as Ragnar does. Instead, he forever keeps himself a student of the world around him, and is always at attention, like he should be. His tendency to have bad nerves, and react with anger over insecurity about his prowess as a fighter, and his status among other Vikings, however, keeps him stray from winning greater confidence of Ragnar to better guide him, for in viking society, being so old and unfortunate, knowledge is second to battle-madness in a man, and is only purposed for battle, and the virtues of knowledge going hand in hand with being brave and ferocious granted by Odin were muted by politicians and other arrogant, showy men.

In the episode Rites of Passage we are first introduced to Floki when Ragnar brings his son Bjorn to visit him. Ragnar described Floki as shy, but he then jumps out in front of Bjorn wearing a mask in an attempt to frighten him. Ragnar told Floki that he will be making their longship for their travels to the west. Floki presents the result: a new kind of ship which allows for travel on the open sea and up rivers. Floki remains nervous about whatever his new design will work. However, as he, Ragnar and Rollo takes it for a virgin-journey, he is overjoyed to find it working perfectly.
